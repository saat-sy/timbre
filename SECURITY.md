# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of Timbre with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

**Note**: As Timbre is currently in early development (v0.1.x), we focus security updates on the latest release. Once we reach stable releases (1.0+), we will maintain security support for multiple versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
